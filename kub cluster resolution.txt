I faced similar issue recently. The problem was cgroup driver. Kubernetes cgroup driver was set to systems but docker was set to systemd. So I created '/etc/docker/daemon.json' and added below:

{
"exec-opts": ["native.cgroupdriver=systemd"]
}
Then

 systemctl daemon-reload
 systemctl restart docker
 systemctl restart kubelet


kubeadm reset & kubeadm init
